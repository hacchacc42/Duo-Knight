It was my lastassignment for the Game Engine Creation module, on Level 4, at Staffordshire University.

The project started in February, as I begin to learn the basis of SDL, then most of the development was in April.

The game is meant to be played in 2, as each player has a special action. The first one is able to break blocks that will 
stun enemies and clear the dungeon path, and the second player can walk through the dugeon rooms. 
In order to pass each level, both player needs to cooperate, and based on their final individual score,if 
their score is closer, they will get more points as a team
